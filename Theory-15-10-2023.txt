-------
Cookies is a piece of information that is stored in the browser or client side.
Cookies is a dictionary that stores the data in the 
form of key and value.
Data stored in the cookies can be accessed anywhere in 
the application.
But since cookies are stored in the browser, data stored 
in the cookies are less secured.

To set data in the cookies response object is used.

Large of amount of data cannot be stored in the cookies
as browser had limited storage.

If large of amount data is stored in the browser,
then for every request that much amount of data must be 
send, that may slow down request response cycle.

syntax:

response_object.set_cookie('key','value')

=============
syntax:

request_object.COOKIES['key']


Session 
=======
1) Session is a piece of information that is stored on  
   server side.
2) Session is dictionary that stores the data in the form of
   key and value.
3) Since session data is stored on the server they are  
more secured as compared to cookies. so Sensitive data such as 
username and password can be stored in session not in cookies.
4) Session data on the server is either stored in the files 
   or in the database table.
   In django there is table named as django_session that 
   stores the data in the form of key and value in encrypted 
   format.

5) To set data in the session request object is used.

==========================
request_object.session['key']=value 

to get data from the session 
============================
data=request_object.session['key']
