Preventing unauthorized or unauthenticated url access 
======================
The pages or url which require mandatory user login or
authentiocation, must check whether user had logged in 
or nor before accessing view in views.py file.
This can be achived with in built 
request.user.is_authenticated attribute of user object.
is_authenticated is a boolean field, whose value is 1 if 
the user is logged in or it is 0 if user is not logged in.
