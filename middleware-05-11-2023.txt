Middleware is a function or a code throught which request 
and response passes.
Every request from client and response from server passes
through middleware.
It is a plug in service.
Middleware is added in the MIDDLEWARE constant in the 
settings.py file.
      Request                Request  
      ---------->          --------->
client           Middleware          server 
      <---------            <---------
        Response              Response


step1: Create a file middleware.py in application folder.
step2: define mddileware function as follow.

       def middlewarename(get_response):
            code to be written that need to executed once.
            initialization 

            def your_functionname(request):
                  code need to executed before view function is called 

                  variable=get_response(request)

                  code need to be executed after views function is called 

                  return variable 
            
            return your_functionname

    

    def middleware(get_response) this function is called 
    when server runs.



def my_middleware() this internal function is called when 
there is a request from client.

step1: request is given by client.
step2: it call my_middleware function and that request passes through 
       my_middleware function.
step3: request from mymiddleware function is then passed to views.py 
      function.
step4: function based view or function in views.py provides 
      response.
step5: this response is captured by variable in middleware function.
       variable=get_response(request)

step6: Then that reponse is passed by middleware to client.
